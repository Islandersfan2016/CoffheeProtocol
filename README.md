WHAT IS FULLY HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYTION?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic scheme that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This capability is significant because traditionally, encrypted data must be decrypted before any meaningful operations can be performed on it, which introduces security risks. FHE overcomes this limitation by enabling computations directly on encrypted data, thereby preserving privacy and security.

Key aspects of Fully Homomorphic Encryption include:

1. Encryption of Data: Data is encrypted using a public key before it is sent to a server or another party. This encryption ensures that the data cannot be read or understood without the corresponding private key.

2. Performing Computations on Encrypted Data: With FHE, computations such as addition, multiplication, and more complex operations can be performed directly on the encrypted data without decrypting it. This is achieved through special algorithms and mathematical techniques that preserve the integrity and confidentiality of the encrypted information.

3. Output of Encrypted Results: The result of these computations is itself encrypted, maintaining the confidentiality of both the input data and the computation's output.

4. Decryption of Results: Finally, the encrypted result can be decrypted using the private key to obtain the plaintext result of the computation.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption has numerous applications in scenarios where data privacy is critical, such as secure cloud computing, confidential data analysis (e.g., in healthcare or finance), and privacy-preserving machine learning. However, it is computationally intensive and historically has been slower than traditional encryption methods, although research continues to improve its efficiency.
